        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Eons ago, I graduated with an Applied Associates Degree in Information Technology.  During my time in school, I dabbled 
            in simple website design.  After graduation, though, my focus shifted towards a different computer science field, and I never 
            took the time to nurture my web Development skills. During the summer of 2024, however, I decided it was time to return to
            my computer science roots. My research led me to Coding Temple, where I began the Software Engineer Bootcamp in October 2024.</p>

        <p>Becoming a Software Engineering sparked my interest because, creative by nature, the thought of being able to develop visually-appealing 
            and intuitive experiences for end-users inspires me.  Front end development is so much more than just having an eye for design, though.  
            These developers directly influence user interactions, and I look forward to being able to put users first and create beautiful, yet 
            functional websites in the near future.</p>

        <p>When I am not studying, I am an outstanding gluten free baker, highly distracted by books, and more than obsessed with Highland cattle.</p>
